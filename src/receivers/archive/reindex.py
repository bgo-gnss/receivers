"""archive_catalog reindex — refresh content_sha256 for files changed out-of-band.

The forward catalog (``catalog.upsert_catalog_row``) is written by the sync
engine for every file it *transfers*. But a file can be modified on the archive
by a path that does NOT go through the engine — notably
``receivers rinex --fix-headers --push``, which rsyncs corrected RINEX straight
to the archive. After such a write the archive bytes change but the catalog's
``content_sha256`` still reflects the pre-edit content, so the scheduled
integrity verify would flag the row as corrupt (a false positive).

Reindex closes that gap: re-hash the authoritative bytes and upsert the row.
The bytes are taken from a local *staging mirror* (the ``--work-dir`` tree that
``--fix-headers`` pushed from) — byte-identical to what rsync placed on the
archive — so no archive mount or ssh read-back is needed. This makes it usable
from a laptop, where this kind of maintenance work actually happens (the
production server is busy with the daily runs).

``content_sha256`` here matches the verify pass exactly: it is taken over the
DECOMPRESSED content (see :mod:`receivers.utils.content_hash`), so a ``.d.Z``
Hatanaka file hashes identically to its decompressed twin, and a header rewrite
changes the hash (which is the whole point).

    Resumable + pausable: a file already counted as indexed on a host is skipped

    file. "Indexed" = ``content_sha256`` present by default (the primary index

    ``limit`` caps the number of files newly hashed this run (the heavy decompress
    + sha256 work), so the archive is indexed in bounded batches with pauses.
    ``sleep_between`` throttles the read rate — a small pause after each file
    keeps a long-running sweep gentle on the NFS mount (pair with ``ionice``).

    Each file is hashed ONCE and fanned out to every host that needs it (rather
    than re-hashing per host) — ``content_sha256`` decompresses the file and is

    canonical archive path, so laptop-written rows collide with the server's
    forward-catalog rows on the logical key (COALESCE upsert → idempotent).

    Note: ``file_date`` is written from the path parse (as ``reindex_files``
    does). It activates the ``verify.py`` local↔archive cross-check, which is
