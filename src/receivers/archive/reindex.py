"""archive_catalog reindex — refresh content_sha256 for files changed out-of-band.

The forward catalog (``catalog.upsert_catalog_row``) is written by the sync
engine for every file it *transfers*. But a file can be modified on the archive
by a path that does NOT go through the engine — notably
``receivers rinex --fix-headers --push``, which rsyncs corrected RINEX straight
to the archive. After such a write the archive bytes change but the catalog's
``content_sha256`` still reflects the pre-edit content, so the scheduled
integrity verify would flag the row as corrupt (a false positive).

Reindex closes that gap: re-hash the authoritative bytes and upsert the row.
The bytes are taken from a local *staging mirror* (the ``--work-dir`` tree that
``--fix-headers`` pushed from) — byte-identical to what rsync placed on the
archive — so no archive mount or ssh read-back is needed. This makes it usable
from a laptop, where this kind of maintenance work actually happens (the
production server is busy with the daily runs).

``content_sha256`` here matches the verify pass exactly: it is taken over the
DECOMPRESSED content (see :mod:`receivers.utils.content_hash`), so a ``.d.Z``
Hatanaka file hashes identically to its decompressed twin, and a header rewrite
changes the hash (which is the whole point).

      ``resolve_catalog_hosts`` returns ``[]``; we fall back to ``[None]`` — the

    """Index already-on-disk archive files into ``archive_catalog`` on every host.

    Resumable + pausable: a file already counted as indexed on a host is skipped
    there — the catalog's own hash-completeness IS the cursor, no separate state
    file. "Indexed" = ``content_sha256`` present by default (the primary index
    hash), so a full-archive sweep touches ONLY the genuinely-uncataloged files
    instead of re-reading the whole archive for rows that were content-hashed by
    prior work. ``require_compressed=True`` also demands ``compressed_sha256`` —
    the deliberate later pass that fills the EPOS-md5 counterpart everywhere.
    ``limit`` caps the number of files newly hashed this run (the heavy decompress
    + sha256 work), so the archive is indexed in bounded batches with pauses.
    ``sleep_between`` throttles the read rate — a small pause after each file
    keeps a long-running sweep gentle on the NFS mount (pair with ``ionice``).

    Each file is hashed ONCE and fanned out to every host that needs it (rather
    than re-hashing per host) — ``content_sha256`` decompresses the file and is
    the expensive step. ``dest_prefix`` maps the local read ``root`` onto the
    canonical archive path, so laptop-written rows collide with the server's
    forward-catalog rows on the logical key (COALESCE upsert → idempotent).

    Note: ``file_date`` is written from the path parse (as ``reindex_files``
    does). It activates the ``verify.py`` local↔archive cross-check, which is
    inert here because the ``archive_verify`` scheduler job stays disabled for
    this rollout.

    **Stub guards — why a size floor exists and what it is NOT.** The walker
    used to hash every file it met, so 0-byte and 3-byte stub RINEX (a failed
    conversion leaves ``1f 9d 90`` — what ``compress`` emits for empty input —
    or a gzip-of-nothing) were catalogued as legitimate archive members. That
    is the most likely origin of the ~14,385 *phantom* rows (rows whose archive
    file no longer exists), and phantom rows are dangerous: ``archive-prune``
    gates LOCAL deletion on catalog presence alone (``_archived_keys`` in
    ``archive/prune.py`` selects ``canonical_key`` with no existence or hash
    check), so a phantom row can authorise deleting the last local copy of data
    whose archive copy is gone. Two guards, with different jobs:

    * **Exact guard (the real one):** skip when the file decompresses to
      nothing — ``content_sha256(f) == EMPTY_CONTENT_SHA256``. Zero false
      positives against legitimately small products, because it tests content,
      not size. Every one of the phantom rows carries exactly this digest and
      no other (the 3-byte stubs too: the hash is over DECOMPRESSED bytes, and
      a stub decompresses to nothing). Counted in ``stats.skipped_empty``.
    * **Cheap pre-filter:** skip without opening when the raw size is below
      ``min_size_bytes`` (default :data:`DEFAULT_MIN_ARCHIVE_FILE_BYTES` =
      128). Counted in ``stats.skipped_small``. The number is MEASURED, not
      chosen by feel: a survey of four months of the read-only archive mount
      (2015/jun, 2019/jul, 2021/sep, 2024/jan; ~400k files) found the stub
      population at 0, 3 and 33 bytes (gzip-of-empty carries its stored
      filename, so that class can reach ~60 bytes for a RINEX-3 long name),
      one 74-byte stray that is an HTTP error body saved as a file, and the
      smallest real catalogable member at 839 bytes (an hourly ``30s_1hr``
      ``.d.Z``; smallest daily 1,197 B, smallest raw 1,448 B).

      The band the floor actually turns on is **75-127 B, and it is empty**:
      re-surveyed over three further months (2017/mar, 2022/oct, 2026/jul) it
      held zero files, so a 128 B floor skips nothing legitimate. Do NOT read
      that as "128-838 B is empty" — it is not. 2017/mar holds
      ``HLID/15s_24hr/rinex/HLID0900.17D.Z``, 268 B compressed / 545 B
      decompressed: a CRINEX header truncated after 7 lines, with no
      ``END OF HEADER`` and zero observation epochs, written by a 2018 bulk
      reconversion. It is a stub, but a **third class that NEITHER guard
      catches** — its digest is real (not :data:`EMPTY_CONTENT_SHA256`) and
      268 B clears any floor that does not also eat real products. Finding
      that class needs a look past the header (no ``END OF HEADER``, or no
      epochs after it), not a size or a hash. So treat "every phantom row
      carries the empty digest" as a description of today's population, not
      as a complete account of how stubs are made — a GC verb keyed only on
      that constant will miss this one.

      Configurable because the survey is a sample, not the whole 9M-file
      archive: ``--min-size-bytes 0`` disables just this guard.

    ``include_stubs=True`` disables BOTH guards (the escape hatch: index
    exactly what is on disk). The floor is applied only to files that would
    otherwise be hashed (after the already-indexed skip), so a resume sweep
    pays no extra stat per already-done file; in ``dry_run`` only the floor can
    run (the exact guard needs the decompress), so a dry-run's ``skipped_empty``
    is always 0 and its ``hashed`` count is an upper bound.

    **Pre-existing phantoms.** These guards prevent NEW phantom rows; they do
    not remove existing ones — there is no file to hash, so no reindex can fix
    them. Spot them with::

        SELECT count(*) FROM archive_catalog
         WHERE storage_location = 'imo_archive'
           AND content_sha256 = 'e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855';

    (the empty-content digest, :data:`EMPTY_CONTENT_SHA256`). Removing them
    needs a GC verb, not yet written; it should classify on that same constant.

    Args:
        hosts: catalog hosts from :func:`resolve_catalog_hosts` (``None`` in the
            list = the default connection).
        files: iterable of local file paths under ``root`` (archive layout).
        root: the mount root the files sit under (e.g. ``/mnt_data/rawgpsdata``).
        storage_location: ``archive_catalog.storage_location`` (e.g.
            ``imo_archive``).
        dest_prefix: the canonical archive dest for ``file_path``.
        limit: stop after this many files are newly hashed (``None`` = no cap).
        dry_run: classify + count, do not hash or write.
        min_size_bytes: raw-size floor below which a file is skipped unopened
            (``0`` disables the floor; the exact guard still applies).
        include_stubs: disable both stub guards and index whatever is on disk.
