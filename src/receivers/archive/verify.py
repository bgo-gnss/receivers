"""archive_catalog verify — detect divergence and confirm files copied intact.

Two integrity checks against the IMO archive catalog (migration 050), both keyed
on the compression-invariant content_sha256 (over DECOMPRESSED content, so a .Z
on the archive compares by content to its local .gz/.d twin):

  1. **local↔archive cross-check** (cheap, DB-only): compare
     ``file_tracking.content_sha256`` (the local copy, filled lazily by the
     integrity checker, mig 052) to ``archive_catalog.content_sha256`` for the
     same logical file. A mismatch means the local and archived copies diverged
     — a re-download, an edit, or corruption on one side.

  2. **read-back verify** (re-hash the archive copy): when a ``read_root`` is
     given (rek-d01 mounts the archive read-only at /mnt/rawgpsdata), re-hash the
     ACTUAL file on the archive and compare to the stored hash. Match → stamp
     ``last_verified_at``. Mismatch → the file did NOT copy intact (archive-side
     bit-rot or a truncated transfer). This is the guarantee behind "edit a
     RINEX locally, push to rawdata, verify nothing got corrupted".

Read-back is the load-bearing check; the cross-check runs for free alongside it
and also works on a host without the mount.
