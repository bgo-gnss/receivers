"""Field-workflow orchestration: install / move / visit operations.

This module is the single source of truth for receiver field operations.
The ``receivers cfg`` CLI subcommands and the standalone ``field_visit.py``
script both call into these Python functions — no logic duplication.

Each operation combines:

* a TOS state change via :class:`tostools.api.tos_writer.TOSWriter`
  (join close+open for moves, vitjun create for visits), and
* an optional ``stations.cfg`` update for installs (the destination
  station gets new ``receiver_serial`` / ``receiver_type`` /
  ``receiver_firmware_version`` / ``rinex_config_valid_from``).

All three operations accept a ``date`` parameter that defaults to *now*
but accepts an arbitrary past date — field work happens first, computer
entry follows, sometimes days later.

The operations default to ``dry_run=True`` (same convention as
:class:`TOSWriter`). The CLI flips the default with ``--no-dry-run`` /
``--live`` after the operator has reviewed the dry-run output.

    Each occupation (a closed receiver + antenna install span) becomes a pair

    ``antenna`` (plus a ``radome`` when the dome is not ``NONE``), each joined

    receiver and antenna for one occupation share the *same* full datetimes,
    they land in a single TOS session (the session-split trap that bites
    ``add-antenna`` cannot occur here).

    Campaign occupations are **metadata-only** — no ``stations.cfg``, download,
    or monitoring footprint is created (campaigns never enter the operational
    system; only the continuous install does). This function therefore writes
    nothing outside TOS.

    Monuments: a campaign does *not* require a monument. When a campaign used a
    tripod over a benchmark, that tripod is recorded as a monument — pass
    ``with_monument=True`` (optionally ``monument_height``) to create one per
    occupation. Default is off (the common DHARP-on-benchmark case, e.g. VOTT).

    Idempotency: an occupation already present as a ``(gnss_receiver, serial,
    start-date)`` session on the station is skipped (see
    :func:`_existing_session_index`); existing device entities are reused by
    serial rather than duplicated.

        owner: Owner label for created devices.
        with_monument: Create a monument per occupation (tripod-over-benchmark).
        monument_height: Mark→ARP height for the monument; defaults to the

      install workflow:

      1. Destination-displacement check: refuse if the station already
         has an open ``gnss_receiver`` child. Move the old one out first.
      2. TOS Pattern 2 move: close the device's current parent join at
         ``date``, open a new join to the station at the same date.
      3. Vitjun ("Breyting") on the destination station with auto-text
         derived from the receiver that just left (``Skipt um móttakara:
         <old> → <new>``); override via ``vitjun``.

         / ``receiver_firmware_version`` / ``rinex_config_valid_from``)
         from the device's TOS attributes.

    * **Location name** (e.g. ``"B9 - Kjallari - Jörð"``, default) —

      1. TOS Pattern 2 move to the warehouse.
      2. Optional vitjun on the *source* station — only when ``vitjun``

      3. No ``stations.cfg`` update (the source station's
         ``receiver_*`` fields will be overwritten by the next station
         move into it, or hand-edited if it's being decommissioned).

    Args:
        serial: Device serial number (must exist in TOS — warehouse new
            arrivals via ``receivers cfg add-receiver`` first).
        to: Destination — a 4-char station marker OR a location name
            as recorded in TOS. Defaults to the B9 warehouse.
        date: ISO date/datetime the move happened. Accepts
            ``YYYY-MM-DD`` (promoted to midnight). Default: today.
            Backdating freely supported.
        from_station: 4-char marker of the source station (transfer
            case). When given on a station→station transfer, sanity-
            checks the device is currently at this station.
        firmware: Optional override of the firmware string written to
            stations.cfg. Does not modify the TOS firmware_version
            attribute. Station destinations only.
        rinex_valid_from: Optional override of the
            ``rinex_config_valid_from`` cfg field (YYYY-MM-DD). Default:
            :func:`_default_rinex_valid_from` applied to ``date``.
            Station destinations only.
        vitjun: Free-text override for the vitjun "Framkvæmt" field.
            Default for station destinations: auto-derived from
            context. For location destinations: no vitjun unless this
            is set.
        vitjun_remaining: Optional "Útistandandi" text for the vitjun.
        participants: Comma-separated emails for the vitjun
            ``participants`` field.
        device_status: When given, runs Pattern-2 on the device's
            ``status`` attribute — closes the current open period at
            ``date`` and opens a new period with this value. Use to
            mark a unit broken (``"bilað"``) when moving it to a
            workshop, or active (``"virkt"``) when redeploying after
            repair. Old devices without an existing ``status`` get
            the value added (no close).
        device_comment: Same Pattern-2 transition for the device's
            ``comment`` attribute — preserves the old comment in
            history. Pass the full new comment text.
        dry_run: When True (default), TOS writes use
            :class:`DryRunResult` and stations.cfg is left alone.
        writer: Optional pre-built TOSWriter.
        cfg_path: Override the stations.cfg location.
        skip_vitjun: When True, skip the vitjun step entirely.
        skip_cfg: When True, skip the stations.cfg update (station
            destinations only).

    For each field in ``fields`` that stations.cfg has a value for, compare

    * ``"add"`` / ``"correct"`` — Pattern 1 upsert (write the open value).
      ``"add"`` is the natural choice when TOS has no value yet; ``"correct"``
      fixes a wrong existing value in place (no history).
    * ``"change"`` — Pattern 2 transition (close the open period at
      ``eff_date``, open a new one). Records history.
    * ``"skip"`` — leave TOS untouched for this field.

    Fields where stations.cfg is empty, or where TOS already matches cfg
    (within ``position_tolerance_m`` for the position group), are no-ops and
    ``confirm`` is never called for them.

    Dry-run is governed by the ``writer`` (a dry-run ``TOSWriter`` turns every

    """One-shot receiver replacement on a station: warehouse + retire + install.

    Encodes the canonical 3-step field workflow as a single operation:

      1. **Warehouse intake** — if the new receiver's serial is not yet
         in TOS, ``create_device`` + B9 join at ``eff_date``. If it's
         already in TOS and parked at B9 (or has no open parent),
         reuse the existing entity. If it's deployed elsewhere, refuse.
      2. **Move OLD** — close the station→OLD join at ``eff_date``,
         open B9→OLD join at the same date, apply
         ``device_status='bilað'`` + comment defaults so the unit
         shows up as out-of-service in B9.
      3. **Install NEW** — close B9→NEW join (if any), open
         station→NEW at ``eff_date``, write the Breyting vitjun on
         the station with auto-derived text, update ``stations.cfg``
         (``receiver_serial``/``receiver_type``/
         ``receiver_firmware_version``/``rinex_config_valid_from``).

    All three steps share the same ``eff_date`` — accepted UI-bug
    trade-off in exchange for a single coherent timestamp.

    Args:
        station_id: 4-char RINEX marker of the destination station.
        new_type: Probe-type for the new receiver — one of the
            entries in :data:`receivers.cfg.device_probe.PROBE_STRATEGIES`.
            Required for the probe protocol selection.
        date: When the swap happened. Default: now. Bare date →
            noon. Used identically for all three transitions.
        host: ``IP[:PORT]`` for the probe. Default: derived from
            ``stations.cfg[station_id].router_ip`` plus the
            probe-type's default port.
        new_serial / new_model / new_firmware: Manual override —
            when all three are given, the probe step is skipped.
            Use for offline entry days after the field visit.
        new_marker: Override the probed marker (when probe doesn't
            return one or the operator wants to assert it).
        owner: TOS owner attribute for the new device entity.
            Default ``"Jarðeðlismælihópur"``.
        old_status: ``status`` attribute value for the OLD device.
            Default ``"bilað"``. Pass ``None`` to leave unchanged.
        old_comment: ``comment`` attribute value for the OLD device.
            Default ``"can't connect to the receiver"``. Pass ``None``
            to skip.
        vitjun: Override the auto-derived vitjun work text on the
            destination station's install record.
        participants: Comma-separated emails for the vitjun.
        continue_from: Skip to step ``"warehouse"`` / ``"move-old"`` /
            ``"install-new"`` for recovery from partial failure.
        skip_marker_check: Bypass the probed-marker-vs-station check
            (use when the receiver's marker is intentionally weird).
        dry_run / writer / cfg_path: As :func:`move_device`.

    Returns:
        :class:`OperationResult` with ``operation="replace"`` and
        per-step responses in ``tos_changes``.

    Raises:
        CfgOperationError: For any precondition failure — unknown

    status shape plus telemetry optionals). This:

      1. Retires the old modem (if any): moves it to the warehouse and applies

      2. Creates the new ``modem_gsm`` device (manual entry — a modem can't be

      4. Updates ``stations.cfg[router_type]`` when ``new_router_type`` is given.

        date: When the swap happened. Default now; bare date → noon.
        old_status / old_comment: Pattern-2 transitions on the OLD modem
            (``None``/``""`` to skip). Default status ``"bilað"``.

    """Close an open ``entity_connection`` (join) by setting its ``time_to``.

    The non-destructive sibling of :func:`delete_join`. ``delete_join`` removes
    a join row that should never have existed; ``close_join`` ends a join that
    was real and is now over — the device left the station. History is
    preserved either way, which is the whole point of the temporal store.

    Two selection modes:

    * **By station + subtype** (preferred) — resolves the station's open child
      of ``subtype`` and closes *its* open parent join. Both lookups confirm
      the join is open before writing, so this mode cannot close an already-
      closed period.
    * **By raw id** (``id_connection``) — patches that row directly. TOS
      exposes no get-join-by-id endpoint, so **no open-check is performed**:
      passing a closed row's id silently rewrites its ``time_to``. Inspect
      ``GET /entity/parent_history/{id_child}`` first (same caveat as
      :func:`delete_join`).

    Args:
        id_connection: Join row ``id`` to close. Mutually exclusive with
            ``station_id``/``subtype``.
        station_id: 4-char marker whose open ``subtype`` child to retire.
        subtype: TOS device subtype (``"antenna"``, ``"radome"``,
            ``"gnss_receiver"``, ``"modem_gsm"``, ``"sim_card"`` …).
        date: When the join ended. Default now; bare date → noon.
        warehouse: When given, *reparent* the device to that warehouse
            (Pattern 2 close+open) instead of leaving it parentless.
            Station+subtype mode only — a raw id identifies a join, not a
            device, so there is nothing to reparent.
        dry_run: When True (default), no writes are sent.
        writer: Optional pre-built TOSWriter.

    """Swap a station's GNSS antenna in TOS (Pattern-2) + ``stations.cfg``.

    The counterpart to :func:`replace_receiver` for the other half of the
    RINEX header. :func:`add_antenna` is *intake* — it refuses when the station
    already has an open antenna, because adding a second open antenna makes
    ``current_session()`` (and therefore station.info, the stream SKL and every
    RINEX header) ambiguous. This verb is the swap:

      1. Retire the old antenna: close its station join at ``date`` (or
         reparent to ``warehouse``) and apply ``old_status``/``old_comment``.
      2. **The radome follows the antenna** — the two are screwed together and
         ~95% of field swaps take both down and put both up. So by default the
         old radome's join is closed and a new radome device is created and
         joined alongside the new antenna. See "Radome semantics" below.
      3. Create (or reuse, when pre-registered) the new antenna and open its
         station join at the same instant.
      4. Write a Breyting vitjun ("Skipt um loftnet: … → …").
      5. Update ``stations.cfg``: ``antenna_type``, ``antenna_serial``,
         ``antenna_radome``, ``antenna_height`` and ``rinex_config_valid_from``.

    **Radome semantics.** A radome is screwed onto the antenna, so the pair
    normally comes down and goes up together — but TOS models them as two
    independent device children, and either can be replaced alone (radome-only:
    :func:`replace_radome`). Three cases, keyed on ``radome`` / ``keep_radome``:

    ==========================  ==================================================
    Flags                       Effect
    ==========================  ==================================================
    *(neither given)*           **Same model, NEW unit.** The old radome's join is
                                closed and a fresh radome device is created with
                                the old one's model. This is the 95% case — a new
                                antenna arriving with its own radome of the usual
                                type. It is an *inferred* write: the carried-
                                forward model is reported in
                                ``tos_changes["plan"]["radome"]`` so a dry-run
                                shows what it decided. With **no** open radome to
                                carry forward, nothing is created and nothing is
                                closed (a station that never had one keeps not
                                having one).
    ``radome="CODE"``           New radome of that model. ``"NONE"`` means the new
                                antenna is bare: old join closed, nothing created.
    ``keep_radome=True``        The physical radome was unscrewed from the old
                                antenna and re-fitted to the new one. Entity and
                                join are left untouched, and cfg
                                ``antenna_radome`` is not rewritten.
    ==========================  ==================================================

    The cfg ``antenna_height`` is a **composite** — antenna ARP height plus the
    monument's mark→ARP offset — which TOS splits across two entities. It is
    derived as ``antenna_height + monument.monument_height`` from the station's
    open monument child; pass ``cfg_antenna_height`` to override. When neither
    is resolvable the operation raises rather than writing a height short by
    the monument offset (a wrong ``ANTENNA: DELTA H`` biases every downstream
    position without erroring anywhere).

    Args:
        station_id: 4-char marker of the station.
        new_model: New antenna model (IGS name or known alias; validated).
        new_serial: New antenna serial; ``None``/empty → synthetic
            ``antenna-<STID>-<YYYYMMDD>`` placeholder (as :func:`add_antenna`).
        antenna_height: New antenna ARP height in metres (TOS
            ``antenna.antenna_height``, RINEX ``ANTENNA: DELTA H``). Required —
            a replacement without a height would silently default to 0.0.
        radome: New radome IGS code, or ``"NONE"`` for "no radome fitted".
            Omit to carry the old radome's model forward — see "Radome
            semantics" above. Mutually exclusive with ``keep_radome``.
        radome_serial: Serial of the new radome. ``None`` → synthetic
            ``radome-<STID>-<YYYYMMDD>`` (the fleet convention — most radomes
            are unserialised), but modern units do carry one and it should be
            recorded when known.
        keep_radome: Re-fit the SAME physical radome onto the new antenna —
            leave its entity and join alone.
        owner: TOS owner attribute for the new devices.
        date: When the swap happened. Default now; bare date → noon (the
            field-work convention shared with ``move-device``/``add-antenna``,
            so co-installs land in one TOS session).
        cfg_antenna_height: Override for the cfg composite height.
        rinex_valid_from: Override ``rinex_config_valid_from``. Default:
            :func:`_default_rinex_valid_from` of the swap date.
        old_status / old_comment: Pattern-2 transitions on the OLD antenna
            (e.g. ``"bilað"``). ``None`` to leave untouched.
        comment: Free-text comment attribute on the NEW antenna.
        vitjun: Override the auto-derived vitjun text.
        participants: Comma-separated emails for the vitjun.
        warehouse: Reparent the old antenna to this warehouse instead of
            leaving it parentless. Off by default — unlike a receiver, a
            retired antenna is as often scrapped as returned, and a wrong
            reparent writes a location claim indistinguishable from a real one.
            Also applies to the **old radome** whenever it is retired: the two
            come off the mast together, so they land in the same place.
        skip_vitjun: Skip the vitjun step.
        skip_cfg: Skip the ``stations.cfg`` write.
        dry_run / writer / cfg_path: As :func:`move_device`.

    Returns:
        :class:`OperationResult` with ``operation="replace-antenna"``.

    Raises:
        CfgOperationError: When the station has no open antenna (use
            ``add-antenna``), has more than one, when the new serial matches
            the open antenna's, when ``antenna_height`` is missing, or when the

    """Swap a station's radome in TOS (Pattern-2) + ``stations.cfg``, antenna untouched.

    The radome-only half of :func:`replace_antenna`. A radome is screwed onto
    the antenna and usually travels with it — but the two are independent TOS
    device children of the station, and a radome does get replaced on its own
    (cracked, snow-loaded, upgraded to a different type over the same antenna).
    This verb covers exactly that case; when both change, use
    ``replace-antenna``, which handles the radome in the same command.

      1. Retire the open radome, if any: close its station join at ``date`` (or
         reparent to ``warehouse``) and apply ``old_status``/``old_comment``.
      2. Create the new ``radome`` device and open its station join.
      3. Write a Breyting vitjun ("Skipt um raðhlíf: … → …").
      4. Update ``stations.cfg[antenna_radome]``.

    With **no** open radome the verb still creates and joins the new one — the
    "a radome was fitted where there wasn't one" case — mirroring how
    :func:`replace_modem` handles a station with no modem on record. Use
    ``new_model="NONE"`` for the inverse (radome removed, none refitted): the
    old join is closed, nothing is created, and cfg records ``NONE``.

    Args:
        station_id: 4-char marker of the station.
        new_model: New radome IGS code (e.g. ``"SCIS"``), or ``"NONE"`` to
            record removal without a replacement.
        new_serial: Radome serial; ``None`` → synthetic
            ``radome-<STID>-<YYYYMMDD>`` (the fleet convention — radomes are
            rarely serialised).
        owner: TOS owner attribute for the new device.
        date: When the swap happened. Default now; bare date → noon.
        old_status / old_comment: Pattern-2 transitions on the OLD radome.
        comment: Free-text comment attribute on the NEW radome.
        vitjun: Override the auto-derived vitjun text.
        participants: Comma-separated emails for the vitjun.
        warehouse: Reparent the old radome instead of leaving it parentless.
            Off by default, as for :func:`replace_antenna`.
        skip_vitjun / skip_cfg: Skip the vitjun / ``stations.cfg`` step.
        dry_run / writer / cfg_path: As :func:`move_device`.

    Returns:
        :class:`OperationResult` with ``operation="replace-radome"``.

    Raises:
        CfgOperationError: When the station has more than one open radome.
        ValueError: When ``new_model`` is not a known IGS radome code — raised
            before any write, so a typo cannot leave the station bare.
