"""Session-aware lookback windows for scheduler jobs.

Scheduler jobs (gap detection, backfill, the archive reconciler, the integrity
checker, morning recovery) all need the same thing: "how far back should this
run look?". Historically every one of them read a ``days_back`` key and did
``end - timedelta(days=days_back)``.

That is wrong for hourly sessions, and expensively so. ``1Hz_1hr`` produces 24
files per station per day, so ``days_back: 30`` over ~332 active stations is
~239,000 files — a number the deployed ``scheduler.yaml`` already complains
about in a comment next to ``archive_reconciler``. The manual CLI path had
quietly diverged and got it right (``cli/main.py``: "-d counts hours not days
for status_1hr, consistent with download"); it was the scheduler that was
inconsistent.

Two keys, one mechanism
-----------------------

``days_back`` keeps its original meaning **exactly**: N calendar days, whatever
the session's file frequency. Every existing config and every runbook that says
"days_back 7" stays true.

``files_back`` is the session-aware alternative: N *files* back, which is N days
for a daily session and N hours for an hourly one.

Both resolve to a single :class:`Lookback` at config-load time so the machinery
downstream has one code path, not two. Setting both in the same section is a
hard error rather than a silent precedence rule — a silent precedence is the
same class of bug this module exists to remove.

Why ``days_back`` is kept rather than redefined
-----------------------------------------------

Redefining it would have been a one-line change, and it would have silently
falsified every comment, runbook and note that mentions it without altering a
single character of them. It also protects a real trap: ``epos_disseminate``'s
``days_back`` is load-bearing as *days* — it is the only backfill window EPOS
has (no gap-reconciler yet), so a day that ages out of it is orphaned until
someone runs ``epos-disseminate --force`` by hand. That section deliberately
keeps ``days_back``.
