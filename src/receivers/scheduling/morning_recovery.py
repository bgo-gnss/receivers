"""Morning recovery — daily catch-up download for stations missing yesterday's file.

Driving incident (2026-05-08): the primary 00:01 window and the 00:36
second-chance retry both miss a class of PolaRX5 stations whose receivers
need 30–90 min after midnight UTC before reliably serving the daily 24h
file via FTP. This job reruns the same `_download_station_data_job` for
those stations at 01:30 UTC — late enough that receivers have settled,
early enough to land before GAMIT processing starts at 03:00–04:00 UTC.

Coexists with the 00:36 second-chance retry. They serve different cases:

* 00:36 retry: catches transient-at-midnight failures (passive→active
  mode flip, brief receiver glitches).
* 01:30 morning recovery: catches receivers that needed an hour or more.

Reuses `_download_station_data_job` end-to-end. Confirms each station's
success via `file_tracking` (status IN ('downloaded', 'archived')).

Configured via `morning_recovery:` section in `scheduler.yaml`. Disabled
by default in package; enabled in the operational deployment via
gps-config-data.

See `docs/design/morning-recovery.md` for the full design rationale.
