"""File archiving utilities for receivers package.

This module provides unified file archiving logic with support for both
immediate and bulk archiving modes. Extracted from receiver implementations
to eliminate code duplication.

Design for extensibility:
- Support for multiple archiving strategies (immediate vs bulk)
- Plugin architecture for compression formats
- Configurable validation and error handling
- Support for custom archiving workflows

#: A raw file of exactly zero bytes is NEVER legitimate data, under any
#: station's baseline, on any receiver model. That certainty is why this guard
#: is absolute and — unlike the statistical data-yield guard below — does NOT
#: fail open: the yield guard answers "is this file too small for this station?",
#: a judgement that must defer to reality when it has no baseline, no DB or too
#: few samples; this one answers "is there any data here at all?", which needs
#: no baseline to decide. Measured 2026-07-05: two stations (ROTH, NVEL) archived
#: a 0-byte SBF that gzip turned into a valid 42-byte empty archive, which then
#: pushed to the long-term archive and was catalogued as the real file — the good
#: local copy survived only by luck. The statistical guard could not have caught
#: it: it did not exist yet, and its fail-open paths would have passed it anyway.
