-- Migration 041: Show chronically failing online stations as missing (red), not gray
--
-- Problem: stations that are online but have broken hardware/no data (GSIG, HEDI,
-- SAVI, SEY9) show status_24h = -1 (gray) instead of 2 (red/missing).
--
-- Root cause: migration 032 added a "file-not-available override" that returns -1
-- whenever a station is online AND has an explicit 'missing' entry in file_tracking
-- for a recent date.  The intent was to handle a transient window where the new
-- daily file hasn't appeared on the receiver yet (SVIN case).  But for stations
-- that are chronically failing (download_log shows 0 completions, 3+ failures) the
-- override incorrectly hides them from the "Missing Raw" indicator.
--
-- Fix: add a guard so the -1 override only fires when the download history does NOT
-- show chronic failure.  Chronic failure (completions=0, failures>=3) falls through
-- to THEN 2 (red/missing) as expected.
