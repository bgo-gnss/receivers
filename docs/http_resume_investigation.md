# HTTP Resume Download Investigation

## Date: 2025-09-30

## Problem Statement

During testing of Phase 1 integration with MANA station (NetR9), slow connection issues were observed:
- Connection timeouts during downloads
- Frequent reconnections
- Only 2 of 3 files successfully downloaded
- Download speeds ~13.6 KB/s with intermittent stalls

## Investigation

### Test Setup

Created test script to check if Trimble NetR9 HTTP API supports HTTP Range requests (resume capability):
- **File**: `tests/test_http_range_support.py`
- **Test station**: MANA (10.4.1.98:8060)
- **Test file**: MANA202509300900b.T02 (1,380,413 bytes)

### Test Results

```
Step 1: Using known test file...
✅ Using test file: MANA202509300900b.T02
   Path: /download/Internal/202509/1Hz_1hr/MANA202509300900b.T02

Step 2: Getting file size...
   URL: http://10.4.1.98:8060/download/Internal/202509/1Hz_1hr/MANA202509300900b.T02
   HEAD response status: 200
   Content-Length: 1,380,413 bytes

Step 3: Testing Range request...
   Requesting bytes 1024-2048
   Response status: 200
   Content-Length: 1380413
❌ Server does NOT support range requests
   (Returned full file with status 200 instead of partial content)
```

### Conclusion

**❌ Trimble NetR9 HTTP API does NOT support HTTP Range requests**

When requesting a specific byte range (`Range: bytes=1024-2048`):
- Server returns status code **200** (not 206 Partial Content)
- Server sends **full file** (1,380,413 bytes) instead of requested range (1,024 bytes)
- No `Accept-Ranges` or `Content-Range` headers in response

**Impact**: Cannot implement resume/incremental download functionality for interrupted transfers.

## Solution: Improved Timeout Configuration

Since resume is not possible, we improved timeout handling to tolerate slow connections:

### Changes Made

#### 1. Configuration File Updates

**File**: `~/.config/gpsconfig/receivers.cfg`

**NetR9 section:**
```ini
[netr9]
# HTTP connection settings
http_port = 8060
# Connect timeout: time to establish connection (increased for slow/remote stations)
http_timeout_connect = 60  # Was: 30 seconds
# Progress-based timeout: only timeout if no data received for this many seconds
# This allows slow downloads to continue as long as progress is being made
http_stall_timeout = 180  # Was: 120 seconds
```

**NetRS section:**
```ini
[netrs]
# HTTP connection settings
http_port = 8060
# Connect timeout: time to establish connection (increased for slow/remote stations)
http_timeout_connect = 60  # Was: 30 seconds
# Stall timeout: max time with no data (increased for slow connections)
http_stall_timeout = 180  # Was: 120 seconds
```

#### 2. Code Default Updates

**File**: `src/receivers/trimble/http_download_client.py` (lines 119-121)
```python
# Get timeout settings from configuration
receivers_config = get_receivers_config()
netr9_config = receivers_config.get_receiver_config("netr9")
# Increased defaults for slow/remote connections
self.connect_timeout = netr9_config.get("http_timeout_connect", 60)  # Was: 30
self.stall_timeout = netr9_config.get("http_stall_timeout", 180)    # Was: 120
```

**File**: `src/receivers/trimble/netrs_http_download_client.py` (lines 124-126)
```python
netrs_config = receivers_config.get_receiver_config("netrs")
# Increased defaults for slow/remote connections
self.connect_timeout = netrs_config.get("http_timeout_connect", 60)  # Was: 30
self.stall_timeout = netrs_config.get("http_stall_timeout", 180)    # Was: 120
```

### Timeout Improvements Summary

| Setting | Old Value | New Value | Improvement |
|---------|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| `http_timeout_connect` | 30 seconds | **60 seconds** | +100% (2x longer) |
| `http_stall_timeout` | 120 seconds | **180 seconds** | +50% (1.5x longer) |

### How It Works

1. **Connect Timeout** (`http_timeout_connect`):
   - Time allowed to establish initial HTTP connection
   - Increased from 30s to 60s for slow/remote stations
   - Prevents premature connection failures

2. **Stall Timeout** (`http_stall_timeout`):
   - Maximum time with **no data received**
   - Download continues as long as **any data arrives**
   - Increased from 120s to 180s
   - Allows very slow transfers (e.g., 13 KB/s) to complete
   - Only fails if connection truly stalls with no progress

## Current Implementation Notes

### Existing Code Behavior

The `http_download_client.py` already has resume detection logic (lines 204-221):

```python
# Check if we should resume download
should_resume, resume_offset = self.file_validator.should_resume_download(
    str(local_path), expected_size
)

if should_resume:
    self.logger.info(f"Resuming download from byte {resume_offset}: {filename}")
    # NetR9 HTTP API doesn't support range requests, so we can't resume
    # Remove partial file and start fresh
    try:
        local_path.unlink()
        self.logger.info(f"Removed partial file for fresh download: {filename}")
    except OSError as e:
        self.logger.warning(f"Could not remove partial file {local_path}: {e}")
```

**This is correct behavior** - partial files are deleted and downloads restart from beginning since resume is not supported.

## Recommendations

### Short Term (Implemented)

✅ **Increase timeouts** - Completed
- More tolerant of slow connections
- Allows complete downloads despite intermittent slowness
- No code changes required beyond configuration

### Medium Term (Optional)

Consider implementing:

1. **Automatic retry with backoff**
   - If download fails, wait and retry
   - Exponential backoff for persistent failures
   - Already partially implemented via urllib3 Retry

2. **Download scheduling optimization**
   - Avoid multiple slow stations downloading simultaneously
   - Prioritize fast stations during congestion
   - Spread downloads across longer time windows for slow stations

3. **Connection pooling improvements**
   - Reuse HTTP connections between files
   - Reduce connection establishment overhead

### Long Term (Future)

If slow connections become a persistent issue:

1. **Implement alternative download methods**
   - FTP as fallback (if receiver supports it)
   - SSH/SCP for critical stations
   - Direct receiver-to-server sync (rsync)

2. **Compression during transfer**
   - If receiver supports it, compress before download
   - Can significantly reduce transfer time

3. **Network infrastructure improvements**
   - Investigate why MANA connection is slow
   - Consider direct network routing improvements
   - Evaluate cellular/satellite connection alternatives

## Testing Next Steps

To verify timeout improvements work:

```bash
# Test MANA download with new timeouts
USE_PHASE1_UTILITIES=1 receivers download MANA -D 3 --session 1Hz_1hr --sync --archive -v

# Expected behavior:
# - Longer tolerance for connection establishment (60s vs 30s)
# - Longer tolerance for slow data transfer (180s vs 120s)
# - Should successfully download all 3 files even with slow connection
```

## Files Modified

1. `~/.config/gpsconfig/receivers.cfg` - Configuration changes
2. `src/receivers/trimble/http_download_client.py` - Default timeout updates
3. `src/receivers/trimble/netrs_http_download_client.py` - Default timeout updates
4. `tests/test_http_range_support.py` - New test script (can be kept for future testing)

## Summary

- ❌ HTTP Range requests NOT supported by Trimble NetR9/NetRS
- ✅ Improved timeout configuration for slow connections
- ✅ Connect timeout: 30s → 60s
- ✅ Stall timeout: 120s → 180s
- ✅ Changes applied to both NetR9 and NetRS
- ✅ Configuration-driven (easy to adjust per deployment)
